# Traffic Control System Simulation

## Overview
This Traffic Control System Simulation uses a real-time traffic management algorithm that leverages machine learning (ML) and AI for intelligent traffic signal control. The project simulates a traffic intersection with vehicles moving in four directions (North, East, South, West) and dynamically adjusts the traffic signal based on real-time traffic data. The goal is to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion, giving priority to emergency vehicles like ambulances.

## Features
- **Real-Time Traffic Management**: Traffic lights change dynamically based on the number of vehicles on each road, reducing congestion.
- **Ambulance Priority**: If an ambulance approaches, the system will give it priority, even if it means temporarily stopping the regular flow of traffic.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Machine learning algorithms are used to predict traffic patterns and optimize signal timing.
- **Simulation**: The simulation is built using Pygame, providing an interactive and visual representation of traffic flow and signal changes.
- **Deployment**: The system can be scaled and deployed on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud for real-time data integration and scalability.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For building the simulation and running the ML algorithms.
- **Pygame**: For simulating the traffic control system and visualizing the simulation in real-time.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: For implementing machine learning algorithms to predict traffic patterns and optimize light changes.
- **APIs**: For integrating real-time traffic data to dynamically adjust the traffic control system.
- **Cloud Deployment**: AWS or Google Cloud for deploying the simulation in a scalable environment.
